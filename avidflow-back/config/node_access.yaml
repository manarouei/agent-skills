# Node Access Configuration
# This file controls which nodes are available to different user tiers
# Changes to this file take effect automatically (hot-reload on file change)

# Access mode determines how filtering works:
# - "whitelist": base_nodes lists exactly what free users CAN access (everything else is VIP)
# - "blacklist": vip_exclusive_nodes lists what free users CANNOT access
access_mode: "whitelist"

# Nodes that are ONLY available to VIP users (subscription holders)
# Only used when access_mode is "blacklist"
vip_exclusive_nodes: []

# Base nodes available to ALL users (including free tier)
# When access_mode is "whitelist", ONLY these nodes are available to free users
# Everything NOT in this list becomes VIP-exclusive
base_nodes:
  # Core/Essential nodes
  - "start"
  - "end"
  - "set"
  - "if"
  - "switch"
  - "merge"
  - "iterator"
  - "filter"
